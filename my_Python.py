#python origin

#Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s.
# Its development began in December 1989, and Guido released the first version, Python 0.9.0, 
#in February 1991. The language was designed with a focus on simplicity and readability, aiming to make programming more accessible and enjoyable. 
#Guido named it after the British comedy group Monty Python, not the snake, to add a bit of humor to the project. 
#Python's syntax emphasizes code readability, with the use of significant whitespace rather than curly braces or keywords, making it easy to understand and learn for beginners.
# Over the years, Python has evolved into one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, used in various fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.

#variables

# In Python, variables are used to store data values. They are containers for storing information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.
# Key points about variables in Python include:Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter automatically determines the type based on the assigned value.
#Variable Naming: Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start with a number. They are case-sensitive.
#Assignment: Variables are assigned using the '=' operator. For example, x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
#Data Types: Variables in Python can hold different types of data, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more.
#declaring variables is a process of naming computer memory spaces

#datatypes
#In Python, data types represent the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in a program. Here's a summary of some of the main data types in Python:
#Numeric Types: int: Integer values without any decimal point.float: Floating-point values, representing real numbers with decimal points.
#complex: Numbers with a real and imaginary part, represented as a + bj, where a and b are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.
#Sequence Types:str: Immutable sequence of characters, representing text data.list: Mutable sequence of elements, allowing heterogeneous data types and dynamic resizing.
#tuple: Immutable sequence of elements, similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation.
#Mapping Type:dict: Collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value. Keys must be unique and immutable.
#Set Types:set: Unordered collection of unique elements, useful for mathematical operations like union, intersection, etc. frozenset: Immutable version of set, which cannot be modified after creation.
#Boolean Type:bool: Represents boolean values True and False, used for logical operations and control flow.
numy=float(numx)
print(numy,"is of a type",type(numy))
numy=str(numx)
print(numy,"is of a type",type(numy))
numy=int(numx)
print(numy,"is of a type",type(numy))

#operators
#Operators in Python are symbols that perform operations on operands, such as variables and values. Here's a summary of the main types of operators in Python:
#Arithmetic Operators:Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), and modulus (%).
#Exponentiation (**): Raises a number to the power of another.
#Assignment Operators:Assigns a value to a variable (=).
#Combines arithmetic operation with assignment (e.g., +=, -=, *=, /=).
#Unary Operators:Operate on a single operand.Includes unary plus (+) and unary minus (-).
